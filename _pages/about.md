I am an assistant professor in the Microelectronics Thrust (Function Hub) at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (GZ).I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Georgia Institute of Technology in 2022, where I was advised by Prof. Shimeng Yu. My research interests are in compute-in-memory, cross-layer hardware & software co-design, heterogeneous computing, AI chips and EDA design.

I am actively looking for motivated PhD/MS with background in computer science, software engineering, electronic engineering in my lab. Please feel free to email me with your CV and transcript if you are interested.
